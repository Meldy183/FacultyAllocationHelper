## üéØ Project Goal and Description

Faculty Allocation Helper is a system designed to streamline faculty allocation across courses and programs. The client currently uses a large, complex spreadsheet to manage this process, involving multiple stakeholders such as hiring departments, course planners, and academic administrators. The goal is to replace this spreadsheet with a structured, user-friendly solution tailored to diverse user needs.
